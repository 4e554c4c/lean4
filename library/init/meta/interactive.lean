   This is a workaround for comment
      https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/1342#issuecomment-307912291
   at issue #1342.

   In interactive mode, given a tactic

        apply f

   we want the apply tactic to create all metavariables. The following
   definition will return `@f` for `f`. That is, it will **not** create
   metavariables for implicit arguments.

   Before we added `i_to_expr_for_apply`, the tactic

       apply le_antisymm

   would first elaborate `le_antisymm`, and create

       @le_antisymm ?m_1 ?m_2 ?m_3 ?m_4

   The type class resolution problem
        ?m_2 : weak_order ?m_1
   by the elaborator since ?m_1 is not assigned yet, and the problem is
   discarded.

   Then, we would invoke `apply_core`, which would create two
   new metavariables for the explicit arguments, and try to unify the resulting
   type with the current target. After the unification,
   the metavariables ?m_1, ?m_3 and ?m_4 are assigned, but we lost
   the information about the pending type class resolution problem.

   With `i_to_expr_for_apply`, `le_antisymm` is elaborate into `@le_antisymm`,
   the apply_core tactic creates all metavariables, and solves the ones that
   can be solved by type class resolution.

   Another possible fix: we modify the elaborator to return pending
   type class resolution problems, and store them in the tactic_state.

If the current goal is a Pi/forall `∀ x : t, u` (resp. `let x := t in u`) then `intro` puts `x : t` (resp. `x := t`) in the local context. The new subgoal target is `u`.

If the goal is an arrow `t → u`, then it puts `h : t` in the local context and the new goal target is `u`.

If the goal is neither a Pi/forall nor begins with a let binder, the tactic `intro` applies the tactic `whnf` until an introduction can be applied or the goal is not head reducible. In the latter case, the tactic fails.

The tactic `introv` allows the user to automatically introduce the variables of a theorem and explicitly name the hypotheses involved. The given names are used to name non-dependent hypotheses.

Examples:
```
example : ∀ a b : nat, a = b → b = a :=
begin
  introv h,
  exact h.symm
end
```
The state after `introv h` is
```
a b : ℕ,
h : a = b
⊢ b = a
```
```
example : ∀ a b : nat, a = b → ∀ c, b = c → a = c :=
begin
  introv h₁ h₂,
  exact h₁.trans h₂
end
```
The state after `introv h₁ h₂` is
```

The `apply` tactic tries to match the current goal against the conclusion of the type of term. The argument term should be a term well-formed in the local context of the main goal. If it succeeds, then the tactic returns as many subgoals as the number of premises that have not been fixed by type inference or type class resolution. Non-dependent premises are added before dependent ones.

The `apply` tactic uses higher-order pattern matching, type class resolution, and first-order unification with dependent types.

`change u` replaces the target `t` of the main goal to `u` provided that `t` is well formed with respect to the local context of the main goal and `t` and `u` are definitionally equal.

`change u at h` will change a local hypothesis to `u`.

Apply `t` to main goal, and revert any new hypothesis in the generated goals,
and tag generated goals when using supported tactics such as: `induction`, `apply`, `cases`, `constructor`, ...

This tactic is useful for writing robust proof scripts that are not sensitive
to the name generation strategy used by `t`.

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type, `induction x` applies induction on `x` to the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor and an inductive hypothesis is added for each recursive argument to the constructor. If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`, that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward, so that the inductive hypothesis incorporates that hypothesis as well.

For example, given `n : nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `induction n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`, and one goal with hypotheses `h : P (nat.succ a)` and `ih₁ : P a → Q a` and target `Q (nat.succ a)`. Here the names `a` and `ih₁` ire chosen automatically.

`induction e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the resulting variable.

`induction e with y₁ ... yₙ`, where `e` is a variable or an expression, specifies that the sequence of names `y₁ ... yₙ` should be used for the arguments to the constructors and inductive hypotheses, including implicit arguments. If the list does not include enough names for all of the arguments, additional names are generated automatically. If too many names are given, the extra ones are ignored. Underscores can be used in the list, in which case the corresponding names are generated automatically. Note that for long sequences of names, the `case` tactic provides a more convenient naming mechanism.

`induction e using r` allows the user to specify the principle of induction that should be used. Here `r` should be a theorem whose result type must be of the form `C t`, where `C` is a bound variable and `t` is a (possibly empty) sequence of bound variables

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type, `destruct x` splits the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type, in which `x` is assumed to be a general instance of that constructor. In contrast to `cases`, the local context is unchanged, i.e. no elements are reverted or introduced.

For example, given `n : nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `destruct n` produces one goal with target `n = 0 → Q n`, and one goal with target `∀ (a : ℕ), (λ (w : ℕ), n = w → Q n) (nat.succ a)`. Here the name `a` is chosen automatically.

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type, `cases x` splits the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor. If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`, that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward, so that the case split affects that hypothesis as well.

For example, given `n : nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `cases n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`, and one goal with hypothesis `h : P (nat.succ a)` and target `Q (nat.succ a)`. Here the name `a` is chosen automatically.

`cases e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal, and then cases on the resulting variable.

`cases e with y₁ ... yₙ`, where `e` is a variable or an expression, specifies that the sequence of names `y₁ ... yₙ` should be used for the arguments to the constructors, including implicit arguments. If the list does not include enough names for all of the arguments, additional names are generated automatically. If too many names are given, the extra ones are ignored. Underscores can be used in the list, in which case the corresponding names are generated automatically.

`cases h : e`, where `e` is a variable or an expression, performs cases on `e` as above, but also adds a hypothesis `h : e = ...` to each hypothesis, where `...` is the constructor instance for that particular case.

`cases_type I` applies the `cases` tactic to a hypothesis `h : (I ...)`
`cases_type I_1 ... I_n` applies the `cases` tactic to a hypothesis `h : (I_1 ...)` or ... or `h : (I_n ...)`
`cases_type* I` is shorthand for `focus1 { repeat { cases_type I } }`
`cases_type! I` only applies `cases` if the number of resulting subgoals is <= 1.

Example: The following tactic destructs all conjunctions and disjunctions in the current goal.
```
cases_type* or and
